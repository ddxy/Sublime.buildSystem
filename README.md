Sublime.buildSystem
===================

1. Create a new folder "Sublime" in the directory C:/
2. Put both batch files "builder" and "loadBuilder" into the created folder.
3. Copy c.sublime-build into "C:\Users\yourAccountName\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages\User" (you need to change yourAccountName to your windows account name)

Additional Tips:
1.use Bitstream Vera Sans Mono font for your command prompt because it supports Unicode. Otherwise in some languages some
characters will be shown weirdly :)
